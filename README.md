# Portal-cli

#### A customer management command-line tool

A simple customer management tool written for fun and for me to mess around with sqlite3.

## Technologies
* [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/)
* [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)
* [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3.8/howto/argparse.html) 

## Setting it up
You will first need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

If you choose not to use [git](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/INSTALL) then download it from [here](https://github.com/xsync3d/portal-cli/archive/master.zip)

#### If using git:
1. Open your terminal in the directory you want to download portal-cli in and paste the following command.
`git clone https://github.com/xsync3d/portal-cli`

3. Now you can run the program by typing `portal.py (arguments)`
or if you're on linux you can run the program by using `./portal.py (arguments)`.
## Usage

You can use the `-h, --help` arguments to see a list of arguments and their usages
